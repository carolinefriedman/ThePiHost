##Title of project
  ThePiHost

##Description
  Description: Short description of the project (help explain to us what you are doing)
  
  For our project this semester in CSCI 3308 Software Development class our group of four has decieded to move forward with creating a gaming host through a raspberry pi which will have many different games loaded onto it such as old nintendo 64 games, classic arcade games, and others of that sort that are hard to find in modern day and can be very expansive to buy and many times are even too old to work on a working game system. We are going to take all the loaded games on the raspberry pi and host them to a website making the raspberry pi more of a remote server that is always running so people can go online to our website and play such games with a usb controller on their own computer anywhere with an internet connection. 


##Vision statement
  Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers)
  
  Bringing the retro 90's games back to life for everyone to play anywhere anytime because the best games are free.

##Motivation: 
  Motivation for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)
  
  The main reason we have chosen to move forward with this idea rather than some of the ideas we can up with as a group such as phone apps or website recreations/applications is because it involes a few different aspecs of computer science, software development and gaming. We really wanted to do some sort of project that would be hands on and involved but also something that interests people and is fun for many vairety of users. The idea to hosts post 90's games through a raspberry pi acting as a server will teach us how to relate hardware with software while also creating code to make menus, sort through the different games and then running them smoothly with no error. When hosting the games we load on this raspberry pi to the internet, we will have to learn and understand how web hosting works while also learning how servers work in real time with transfering game data back and forth from the host to client playing the game. Even though the raspberry pi is very very small representation of a server, it will still require us to understand the fundamentals of how servers work and operate.

##Risks
  Risks: to project completion 
  
  When deciding to move forward with our project is was pretty easy to identify the risks and hardships we will have to overcome in order to have a sucessful project. While we are working with a group of four and everyone brings to the table something a little different there are still many things we as a team do not know how to do such as web hosting, creating a working server (Raspberry Pi server), creating scripts to run the raspberry pi and boot games onto it. We also as a team have never messed around with a raspberry pi so learning the python language and scripts necessary to boot it, run it and then run our game program which will be a mix of Java and C++ will all be risks that need to be accounted for.  
  
##Mitigation 
  Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk  
  
  In order to deal with the many risks we have as a team we have decided to split up the duties of certain tasks as a normal team in industry would do. Austin and Caroline are going to be in charge of learning and mastering the ins and outs of the Raspberry Pi and getting it running with the preloaded games we want. We will have to create the scripts necessary to boot the Raspberry Pi and have those scripts also load the menu controlling which game you would like to play as a user when the Raspberry Pi is powered on. We are going to assume this Raspberry Pi has only a few functions, the boot process, the loading of the game menu and the connection to the website where the games are being hosted. Galen and Josh are going to be in charge of the web hosting of the games and creating the website through which they will be hosted. They will also be in charge of connecting the pi as a server to the host website. We as a team are going to create a game in addition to all the games we preload from online emulators from the post 90's type games as well as well known arcade games that are still popular today.
