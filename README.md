## Description

  Over the duration of this semester our group has developed an arcade-style computer gaming application.  Our goal was to provide an environment where a user could achieve an arcade-like nostalgia from the comfort of their own home.  To address this goal, contained in our application is a set of video games that are reminiscent of the vintage video games that we all know and love.  In particular, the contents of our application include Tennis (a recreation of the 70's game Pong), Space Defenders (a recreation of the 70's game Space Invaders), and, to provide our users with a more modern gaming system, we included a copy of the open source project "OpenEmu" so that users could easily add their own games to their collection and access them through our applications connectino to OpenEmu.
  <br />
  The games that we coded (Space Defenders (aka "Space Invaders") and Tennis (aka "Pong").  Allow the users to not only play the game, but track their scores and progress.  Within each game, there are different way to "level-up" and score points.  At the end of the game, in the game over screen, our code queries a high-scores database to update the score of the most recently terminated game and print the top three high-scores for the game. <br />
  Our application can be downloaded from the website that we created.  This website includes screenshots of the games, a package downloader, and installation instructions.
  Our website can be accessed in one of two ways: <br />
  This first method of accessing our website at the url that is hosted by the raspberryPi, thepihost.sytes.net .  In order to access the website hosted by the raspberryPi, the Pi server must must on and hosting.<br />
The second method of accessing our website is at http://creative.colorado.edu/~cafr3980/the-pi-host/ .  This location offers an identical website as the one hosted by the Pi except that it can be accessed at any time.
<br />
Once at our website, simply scroll down the page to the download section and click on “DOWNLOAD” to obtain the application package.  The following steps and dependencies must be observed to launch our application:

Dependencies:
Program must be run on a Mac computer
User must have Java installed

Download Steps:
