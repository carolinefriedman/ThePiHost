## Description

Over the duration of this semester our group has developed an arcade-style computer gaming application.  Our goal was to provide an environment where a user could achieve an arcade-like nostalgia from the comfort of their own home.  To address this goal, contained in our application is a set of video games that are reminiscent of the vintage video games that we all know and love.  In particular, the contents of our application include Tennis (a recreation of the 70's game Pong), Space Defenders (a recreation of the 70's game Space Invaders), and, to provide our users with a more modern gaming system, we included a copy of the open source project "OpenEmu" so that users could easily add their own games to their collection and access them through our applications connectino to OpenEmu.

<br />

The games that we coded (Space Defenders (aka "Space Invaders") and Tennis (aka "Pong").  Allow the users to not only play the game, but track their scores and progress.  Within each game, there are different way to "level-up" and score points.  At the end of the game, in the game over screen, our code queries a high-scores database to update the score of the most recently terminated game and print the top three high-scores for the game. 
<br /><br />
Our application can be downloaded from the website that we created.  This website includes screenshots of the games, a package downloader, and installation instructions.  Our website can be accessed in one of two ways: <br /><br />
This first method of accessing our website at the url that is hosted by the raspberryPi, thepihost.sytes.net .  In order to access the website hosted by the raspberryPi, the Pi server must must on and hosting.
<br /><br />
The second method of accessing our website is at http://creative.colorado.edu/~cafr3980/the-pi-host/ .  This location offers an identical website as the one hosted by the Pi except that it can be accessed at any time.
<br /><br />
Once at our website, simply scroll down the page to the download section and click on “DOWNLOAD” to obtain the application package.  The following steps and dependencies must be observed to launch our application:

## Repository Organization
In the master branch of our github repository, you fill find the folliwing files and folders:<br />
- Automated Testing
Within the Automated Testing folder are the unit tests that were made for the tennis and space Defenders games.  The Automated Testing folder contains to subdirectories, AutomatedTesting_SpaceDefenders and AutomatedTesting_Tennis.  Within each directory contains an src folder (with the JUnit unit testing code and the Cucumber unit test runner for each class), a bin folder (for the unit test binary executables), and a .settings folder.  All unit testing for this class was done with JUnit and Cucumber.
- Documentation
<br />
The Documentation folder contains the javadoc automated documentation that was generated for the menu, the Space Defenders game, and the Tennis game.  It contains two initial subfloders, one for the raw html generated by Javadoc, and one with the PDF form of the documentation for these application components (the menu, the Space Defenders game, and the Tennis game).
- Website
<br />
The Website folder contains the html, css, and javascript used to generated our website, along with the website assets.
- menuTesting
<br />
The menuTesting folder (this is not just test code) contains all of the source code for the launch menu executable.
- spaceDefenersDB
<br />
The spaceDefendersDB folder contains all of the source code for the spaceDefenders game.
- tennisDB
<br />
The tennisDB folder contains all of the source code for the tennis game.
